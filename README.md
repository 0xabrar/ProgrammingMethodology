ProgrammingMethodology
======================


The repository is meant to keep track of the my work for the class CS106A: Programming Methodology by Stanford University 
(completed originally in 2009). The course is part of Stanford University's Stanford Engineering Everywhere (SEE) program.

All initial work relies on the ACM libraries that are provided, but, in the future, that may change.
Information about each individual assignment may be found here:
http://see.stanford.edu/see/materials/icspmcs106a/assignments.aspx

The assignment solutions have been deemed sub-optimal and at a future date, may be improved and expanded upon.
In the meantime, this second-rate undocumented code will remain on Github. 

I'm talking to you future Abrar. This code is bad and you should feel bad. But, then again, the past Abrar that wrote
this code, whom we both can refer to in correct reference, was only 13. Anyways, don't be lazy. Fix this thing, which, 
in your point of reference, past Abrar was too lazy to fix (aka the Abrar writing this right now).

Issues
- assignment3 : side-side collisions don't work
- other assignments : a lot of other things

At the end of the day, this is totally 100X greater than Raunaq Suri's code. Let no one forget that. 

Edit: I'm a liar. I actually haven't read Raunaq's source code. Time to find his Github!
